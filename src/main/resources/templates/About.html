                This is a fighting game.
                The objective of the game is for players to fight in different stages, 
                where their life bar works like a battery each hit causes them to lose a percentage of power. 
                Players can upgrade or level up based on how many fights they win, and they can also level 
                down based on how many fights they lose.
